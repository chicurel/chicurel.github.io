Welcome to my website. I am a research assistant currently working at [CSIC - IPP](https://www.ipp.csic.es/). 

I studied Economics at [Universidad Carlos III](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/economics?d=Desktop) where I specialized in Econometrics and Macroeconomics. I also hold a master's degree of [Computational Social Science](https://www.uc3m.es/master/computational-social-science).

As an experienced econometrician and macroeconomist, I am dedicated to using data-driven analysis to inform monetary and financial policy in the European Union. I specialize in working with large data sets and interpreting the results to make informed decisions. My ultimate goal is to master the most advanced tools in this field and make a significant impact on current policy issues.
