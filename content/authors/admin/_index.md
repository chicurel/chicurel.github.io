Welcome to my website. I’m an economist and data scientist with a strong background in econometrics, macroeconomic analysis and data science, now pursuing a [PhD in Statistics for Data Science](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/Doctorado/en/Detalle/Estudio_C/1371364859211/1371210298470/Statistics_for_Data_Science) working at [CSIC - IPP](https://www.ipp.csic.es/). 

I studied Economics at [Universidad Carlos III](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/economics?d=Desktop) where I specialized in Econometrics and Macroeconomics. I also hold a master's degree in [Computational Social Sciences](https://www.uc3m.es/master/computational-social-science).

I'm an economist and data scientist with a strong background in econometrics and macroeconomic analysis. I work with complex datasets to uncover insights that support decision-making in both public and private sectors. My experience spans academia, central banking, and entrepreneurship, with projects ranging from international trade and supply chains to labor markets and public policy. I’m skilled in tools like R and Python, and focus on turning data into clear, actionable analysis—whether through predictive modeling, policy evaluation, or business analytics. I aim to connect rigorous economic research with practical impact, helping organizations navigate uncertainty and make informed, data-driven decisions. 📊👨🏻‍💻📈
