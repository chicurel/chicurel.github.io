title: 'Pathways to power: the political representation of citizens of immigrant origin in seven european democracies'
summary: 'A cooperative international endeavor on the political representation of citizens of immigrant origin in seven European Democracies. Immigration is one of the most important challenges facing Europe today. Social and political participation constitutes the ultimate expression of integration in society. Our project seeks to advance knowledge on descriptive representation of citizens of immigrant origin at the national and regional levels over a twenty year period. Additionally, the project adds an innovative dimension by examining substantive representation of citizens of immigrant origin at the national level. We examine participation patterns in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom.
