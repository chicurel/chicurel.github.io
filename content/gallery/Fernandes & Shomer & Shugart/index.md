Electoral systems are the cornerstone of representation. Their rules and functioning shape the channelling of political and economic interests and the extent to which representatives are accountable to citizens. Carey and Shugart’s seminal contribution in the mid-1990s triggered an explosion in the comparative politics literature in the study of the effects of electoral systems, the personal vote and representation. Carey and Shugart’s contribution offered an analytical framework whose capacity to travel and to analyze distinct institutional designs made it highly influential. Many scholars have tested, and extended, Carey and Shugart’s framework, often with contradictory findings. In this paper, our goal is to provide a review of the literature on electoral systems and personal vote. First, we begin by mapping the intellectual roots of the personal vote concept and revisiting Carey and Shugart’s original argument. Second, we discuss the empirical indicators that scholars have used to measure personalist behavior. Third, we offer a classification scheme whose goal is to map the literature along two dimensions: legislators’ goals and principals. Fourth, we debate the literature along those two dimensions. Finally, we set the road ahead and point out to future research avenues.
