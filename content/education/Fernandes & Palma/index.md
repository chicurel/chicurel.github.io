Structural funds are considered to be an important EU policy to shore up cohesion, inclusiveness and help the development of poorer countries. We argue that for all the governance accountability mechanisms set in place at the EU level, structural funds have had unintended consequences. They create incentives for resource curse, conditional on institutional design at the national level. Resource curse has both economic and political components. In response to an exogenous increase in resources, the economic component (Dutch disease) consists of a rise in the price of tradable relative to non-tradables, which leads to a loss of competitiveness of national tradable industry. The political component relates to increased state capture, declining quality of institutions, and decrease accountability, because national elites do not need to deliver efficient policies. We illustrate our mechanisms turning to Portugal as a case study. Portugal has been a net receiver of structural funds since its accession to the EU in 1986. For all the structural funds received over the past 35 years, after an early period of convergence, the country has been losing competitiveness, its economy has been stagnated for 20 years, and international indicators such as V-Dem suggest a decline in the quality of democracy.
