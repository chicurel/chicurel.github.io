The emergence of the radical right signals that social norms and values are changing. Existing literature suggests that citizens choose to voice their concerns when faced with the erosion of democracy. In this paper, we look at whether speaking out against the radical right is effective in hollowing its influence, or if it backfires and helps radical right parties to secure more support. Using Twitter data from Portugal, we use node embeddings to map out interactions on social media. Subsequently, we estimate a deep-learning automated sentiment analysis of quoted tweets and use a vector auto-regression model to forecast who contributes the most to the growth of the radical right on Twitter: users who espouse negative sentiments or those who show positive sentiments towards the fledgling party. Evidence suggests that users who express negative sentiments towards the radical right contribute the most to its growth and influence on Twitter.
