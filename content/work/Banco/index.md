As an intern at the Spanish Central Bank, I gained valuable experience in data analysis and research. My responsibilities included collecting, cleaning and analyzing large datasets using R and STATA. I assisted in several research projects, including building a supply bottlenecks index using word embedding technique, as well as performing economic analyses like regressions. My work on a project involving 200 million observations related to imports and exports and focus on dependencies on EU imports was especially noteworthy. Through these projects, I developed expertise in data collection, descriptive statistics and performing initial economic analysis.
