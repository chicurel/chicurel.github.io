title: 'The Secret Garden of politics: candidate selection in portugal: 1975-2019'
summary: 'The current project aims to make the most comprehensive data collection on candidate selection in Portugal. According to our codebook, our data collection effort will cover all national elections in Portugal since democratization, from 1975 through 2019. To the best of my knowledge, there are only two countries in Europe for which individual-level data for all candidates have been collected for an extended period of observation: the United Kingdom (van Heerde-Hudson and Campbell 2015) and Norway (Fiva and Smith 2017). Our goal is to retrieve information on all candidates, for all political parties, even for those who have not garnered sufficient support to elect a representative to parliament.
