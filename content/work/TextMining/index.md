Led a hands-on Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, teaching practical skills in text cleaning, tokenization, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling using Python. Introduced students to advanced NLP with large language models (LLMs) like BERT for sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Covered Bag of Words and TF-IDF representations, n-grams, LDA and NMF topic modeling, as well as visualization techniques like word clouds and correlation graphs. Delivered real-world projects, including sentiment analysis and parliamentary speech modeling, equipping participants to apply text analysis and NLP solutions effectively in Data Science and Business Intelligence contexts.
