Responsible for collecting, organizing, and maintaining databases efficiently to facilitate analysis. Designed and presented data in a clear and comprehensible manner for diverse audiences, applying knowledge of economics and causal inference to enrich analyses and conclusions. Worked with text data using text mining techniques and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, including sentiment analysis of political and economic texts. My work contributed to the efficiency and accuracy of research, supported the preparation of reports and publications, and aided in disseminating findings within the academic and policy-making communities.
