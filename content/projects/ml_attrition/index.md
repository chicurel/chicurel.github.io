In this project, I developed two separate models to predict attrition and monthly income. I explored various techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks and evaluated the modelsâ€™ performance using appropriate metrics. The goal in this project was to provide insights into the factors that are most strongly associated with employee attrition and to estimate the typical salary levels of employees based on their individual characteristics and see if they are over or under payed.
